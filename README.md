# portfolio

Welcome!

Thanks for taking your time and viewing my portfolio. This is a porfolio to demonstrate a bit of
what I have done and do in my research field and spare time with two main languages- Python and C++.

What to expect:

1) Python_Projects: you will find my personal projects in Quantitative Research
(under the folder "Quant", portfolio/Python_Projects/Quant) and other codes utilizing variety of numerical methods and algorithms, such as 
Gradient Descent, Steepest Gradient Descent, Newton's method, Thomas algorithm, and Bisection method, 
for optimization, data fitting, and solving for the optimal learning rate. In addition, the folder with
DNN algorithms (portfolio/Python_Projects/DNN) contain algorithms developed for my current research papers and displays my familarity and
experience with PyTorch.

2) C++_Projects: you may find implementations of numerical methods such as Newton's and Secant methods, and Chebyshev polynomials and Lagrange
interpolation. Mainly, these codes were written for a numerical methods class,
after I have taken considerable amount of time off from C++ coding, so I preemptively apologize for their unpolishedness. Newer C++ projects,
such as data fitting and analytics problems that can be found at Hackerrank will be uploaded soon. 

Again, thank you for taking your time and reading. I look forward to any feedback or collaborations.
