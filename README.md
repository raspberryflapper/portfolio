# portfolio

Welcome!

Thanks for taking your time and viewing my portfolio. This is a porfolio to demonstrate a bit of
what I have done and do in my research field and spare time with two main languages- Python and C++.
Mainly, I use coding skills to optimize and fit data (e.g. lab data of tumor growth)
and solve Ordinary Differential Equations, using well known methods such as Runge Kutta. 
Recently, I have been using Neural Network (NN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) with PyTorch to solve systems of ODEs. 
These DNN codes will be uploaded soon.

This reposit is divided into two main folders:

In the Python folder -  you may find some codes for optimization and data fitting,
utilizing methods such as Gradient Descent, Steepest Gradient Descent, and Bisection methods to solve for the optimal learning rate.
These codes were mainly used for data fitting and finding the optimal parameters. Some codes are for Least Square Error analysis of the
found parameters and finite difference method (2nd order accuracy) to solve second order ODE.

In the C++ folder - you may find implementations of method such as Newton's, Secant, Trapezoid, and etc. Mainly,
these codes were written for a numerical methods class, after I have taken considerable amount of time off from C++ coding, so I preemptively apologize for their unpolishedness.
