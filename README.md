# portfolio

Welcome!

Thanks for taking your time and viewing my portfolio. This is a porfolio to demonstrate a bit of
what I have done and do in my research field and spare time with two main languages- Python and C++.
Mainly, I use coding skills to optimize and fit data (e.g. lab data of tumor growth)
and solve Ordinary Differential Equations, using well known methods such as Runge Kutta, finite difference, 
and Euler's method. Recently, I have been using Deep Neural Network (DNN) with PyTorch to solve systems of ODEs.
Currently, my DNN algorithm can take in real-world lab data and solve a complex system of ODE/biological models
with undetermined coefficients.

This reposit is divided into two main folders:

In the Python folder -  you will find codes utilizing variety of numerical methods and algorithms, such as 
Gradient Descent, Steepest Gradient Descent, Newton's method, Thomas algorithm, and Bisection method, 
for optimization, data fitting, and solving for the optimal learning rate. In addition, the folder with
DNN algorithms contain algorithms developed for my current research papers. In different projects/codes,
reader can observe different skillsets used, whether that be fitting a data in the Least Square sense or
handling a Jacobian matrix to solve a second order ODE with the second order finite difference method. Lastly,
some codes are written for calculating the Residual Square Sum for an analysis of the found optimal parameters and
for a course I took at the University of South Carolina (consisting of Trapezoid, Simpson, Linear Spline, Midpoint, and 
Cubic spline numerical methods) back in Fall 2022 (some of them are very unrefined).

In the C++ folder - you may find implementations of numerical methods such as Newton's and Secant methods, and Chebyshev polynomials and Lagrange
interpolation. Mainly, these codes were written for a numerical methods class,
after I have taken considerable amount of time off from C++ coding, so I preemptively apologize for their unpolishedness. Newer C++ projects,
such as data fitting and analytics problems that can be found at Hackerrank will be uploaded soon. 

Again, thank you for taking your time and reading. I look forward to any feedback or collaborations.
