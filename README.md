# portfolio

Welcome!

Thanks for taking your time and viewing my portfolio. This is a porfolio to demonstrate a bit of
what I have done and do in my research field and spare time with two main languages- Python and C++.
Mainly, I use coding skills to optimize and fit data (e.g. lab data of tumor growth)
and solve Ordinary Differential Equations, using well known methods such as Runge Kutta. 
Recently, I have been using Neural Network (NN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) with PyTorch to solve systems of ODEs. 
These DNN codes will be uploaded soon.

This reposit is divided into two main folders:

In the Python folder -  you will find codes utilizing variety of numerical methods and algorithms, such as 
Gradient Descent, Steepest Gradient Descent, Newton's method, Thomas algorithm, and Bisection method, 
for optimization, data fitting, and solving for the optimal learning rate. In different projects/codes,
reader can observe different skillsets used, whether that be fitting a data in the Least Square sense or
handling a Jacobian matrix to solve a second order ODE with the second order finite difference method. Lastly,
some codes are written for calculating the Residual Square Sum for an analysis of the found optimal parameters.

In the C++ folder - you may find implementations of method such as Newton's, Secant, Trapezoid, and etc. Mainly,
these codes were written for a numerical methods class, after I have taken considerable amount of time off from C++ coding, so I preemptively apologize for their unpolishedness. 

Again, thank you for taking your time and reading. I look forward to any feedback or collaborations.
